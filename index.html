                <h2 class="h-secondary center">• Polycrystalline Solar Panels for Home</h2>
                <p>
                    These types of solar panels are created by many fragments of silicon together to form the wafers for them. In addition, they are best suited for Indian conditions. Especially if the solar panels for home costs are as affordable – it sure is a smart investment!

o Sustainable:

Polycrystalline solar panels can keep delivering optimal performance for 25 years and, therefore, have a long service life.

o Cost-Effective:

These types of solar panels are less expensive to produce and are ideal for Indian climatic conditions with an output efficiency of 13-17%.
Clean, pure energy is derived from solar power systems. Installing solar panels on your rooftop combats greenhouse gas emissions and decreases fossil fuel dependency.

Whenever you decide to install solar power systems like a solar panel, you will have two options to choose from.

1. Polycrystalline Solar Panels
2. Mono Perc Solar Panels
The purpose and functions of both are the same: to capture the energy of sunlight and convert it into electricity. However, there are specific technical differences between poly perc and mono perc solar panels.

Polycrystalline Solar Panels for Home by Luminous
They are made of crystal, and their appearance is in a blue shade which is different from the monocrystalline cells. Along with this, poly cells are quadrilateral in shape. Polycrystalline solar panels for home come in 40 watts to 330 watts. Also, the output efficiency of polycrystalline-based solar panels is typically 13-17%. These solar panels perform well for 25 years and can make your house a green power generating home!

                <h2 class="h-secondary center">BENEFITS OF MONOCRYSTALLINE PERC SOLar PANELS :-</h2>
                <p> 
                    Highly Efficient:
                    
                    Such types of solar panels are made using Monocrystalline PERC solar cells convert the maximum amount of solar energy into electricity. If you want to maximize electricity generation using solar energy from a specific area, such as your roof, then Monocrystalline Perc solar panels are the best choice.
                    
                    o PERC technology:
                    
                    These solar panels come with PERC (Passivated Emitter and Rear Cell) technology in which additional back layer film is etched behind the solar cells which helps in absorption of scattered or reflected sunlight resulting in higher power generation and achieving panel efficiency of up to 20%.
                    
                    o Space Efficient:
                    
                    Monocrystalline PERC solar panels can generate more power in less rooftop area and take less space for installation leading to reduction in Balance of System (BOS) costs and making them space efficient solar panels .
